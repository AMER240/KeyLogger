# Educational KeyLogger - README

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT WARNING ⚠️

**THIS SOFTWARE IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY!**

- **Only use with explicit written consent** from the target user
- **Never use without permission** - this is illegal and unethical
- **This is for learning cybersecurity concepts only**
- **Always follow local laws and regulations**

## What This Project Demonstrates

This educational keylogger demonstrates:

1. **Windows API Hooks** - How to intercept system-level keyboard events
2. **Low-Level Keyboard Procedures** - Understanding Windows message processing
3. **Global Hook Implementation** - System-wide event monitoring
4. **Real-time Data Processing** - Handling keyboard input in real-time
5. **File I/O Operations** - Logging data to files
6. **WinForms UI Development** - Creating user interfaces for monitoring tools

## Features

- **Real-time keystroke monitoring** with timestamp
- **File logging** to desktop (EducationalKeyLogger.txt)
- **UI display** showing captured keystrokes
- **Start/Stop controls** for logging
- **Save functionality** to export logs
- **Educational warnings** and consent dialogs
- **Special key handling** (Enter, Space, Ctrl, etc.)

## How It Works

### Technical Implementation

1. **Windows Hook API**: Uses `SetWindowsHookEx` with `WH_KEYBOARD_LL` to create a low-level keyboard hook
2. **Hook Procedure**: `HookCallback` function processes keyboard messages
3. **Key Processing**: Converts virtual key codes to readable key names
4. **Logging**: Writes keystrokes to both UI and file with timestamps
5. **Thread Safety**: Properly handles cross-thread UI updates

### Key Components

- `KeyLogger.cs` - Core keylogging functionality
- `Form1.cs` - User interface and controls
- Windows API declarations for hook management

## Building and Running

1. Open the solution in Visual Studio
2. Build the project (Ctrl+Shift+B)
3. Run in Debug or Release mode
4. **Remember**: Only use with proper consent!

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

### Legal Requirements
- Obtain **written consent** before use
- Follow **local privacy laws**
- Understand **computer crime statutes**
- Consider **data protection regulations**

### Ethical Guidelines
- Use only for **educational purposes**
- Never use on **unauthorized systems**
- Respect **user privacy**
- Be transparent about **monitoring activities**

## Educational Value
